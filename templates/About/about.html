          <h2>What is DSGBase?</h2>
          <p>
            DSGBase is a personalized data management system designed to
            securely store and organize personal identity records such as full
            name, region, and ID number. It provides a private environment where
            users can manage their information with clarity and control.

          <h2>How it Works</h2>
          <p>
            DSGBase allows users to input and store essential personal data in a
            structured format. The platform is organized into core sections like
            <strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Base</strong>, and
            <strong>Settings</strong>, which help navigate and manage data
            effectively. Each record is associated with identifiable attributes,
            such as region or ID, ensuring that the information is both
            meaningful and retrievable.

          <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
          <p>
            DSGBase is built for general users who want a simple yet powerful
            tool for managing personal information. Whether you're an individual
            looking to organize identity-related data or a small group managing
            private records, DSGBase is designed to be intuitive and
            user-focused.

        <section class="about-section">
          <h2>Security & Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            All data is stored locally on the device where DSGBase is used. It
            is not connected to the internet or any external servers, making it
            fully private and non-shareable by design. Your information stays
            with you — and only with you.
          </p>

        <section class="about-section">
          <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
          <p>
            DSGBase is developed using a blend of low-level and web technologies
            — <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> — to ensure efficiency, flexibility, and
            responsiveness.

          <h2>Created By</h2>
          <p>
            DSGBase was developed by <strong>!!D7FEX</strong> and
            <strong>Gurjaka</strong> with the goal of providing a clean,
            offline-first personal database experience for everyone.
